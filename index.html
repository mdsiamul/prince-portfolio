            <p>A web developer is a programmer who specializes in, or is specifically engaged in, the development of
                World Wide Web applications using a clientâ€“server model. The applications typically use HTML, CSS and
                JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#), Python, Node.js, Go or Java in the server, and http for
                communications between client and server. A web content management system is often used to develop and
                maintain web applications.</p>
